### Web UI

Our web UI is based on hugely outdated frameworks - it's a known problem and if
you'd like to do something about it, please get in touch. This means there are
most likely published security issues with some of our web UI dependencies: Do
not report any security issues solely based on that. Of course please do report
if you identified a concrete security issue in our web UI (regardless of whether
it's connected to a published issue in a dependency or not).
